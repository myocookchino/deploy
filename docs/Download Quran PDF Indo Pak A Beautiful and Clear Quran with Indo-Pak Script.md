## Indo Pak Script
 
Indo Pak script is a variant of the Naskh script, which is one of the six major scripts of Arabic calligraphy. Naskh means "copying" or "transcription", and it was developed in the 10th century CE by Ibn Muqlah, a famous calligrapher and vizier of the Abbasid caliphate. Naskh was designed to be easy to write and read, and it became the standard script for copying the Quran and other religious texts.

Indo Pak script emerged as a regional adaptation of Naskh in South Asia, where Islam spread through trade, conquest, and missionary activities. Indo Pak script reflects the influence of local languages and cultures, such as Urdu, Hindi, Persian, and Turkish. Indo Pak script has more diacritical marks and vowel signs than Naskh, which help to distinguish between similar letters and sounds. For example, Indo Pak script uses dots above or below certain letters to indicate short vowels (a, i, u), while Naskh uses small strokes or curves. Indo Pak script also uses different shapes for some letters depending on their position in a word (initial, medial, final, isolated), while Naskh uses the same shape for all positions.
 
Indo Pak script is widely used and taught in South Asia, especially in madrasas (Islamic schools) and mosques. It is also popular among Muslims who live in other regions but have roots or connections in South Asia. Many Quran translations and commentaries are written in Indo Pak script, along with Arabic text.
 
## Madinah Script
 
Madinah script is a variant of the Uthmani script, which is another one of the six major scripts of Arabic calligraphy. Uthmani means "of Uthman", and it refers to the third caliph of Islam, Uthman ibn Affan, who ordered the compilation and standardization of the Quran in the 7th century CE. Uthmani script was used to write the original manuscript of the Quran, which is also known as Mushaf Uthmani or Mushaf al-Madinah (the Book of Madinah).
 
Madinah script emerged as a modern adaptation of Uthmani script in Saudi Arabia, where Islam originated and where the two holiest cities of Islam, Mecca and Madinah, are located. Madinah script reflects the influence of the Saudi government and its official interpretation of Islam, known as Wahhabism or Salafism. Madinah script has fewer marks and signs than Uthmani, which make it closer to the original manuscript of the Quran. For example, Madinah script does not use dots or strokes to indicate short vowels (a, i, u), but only uses small symbols called sukun (no vowel) and shadda (double consonant). Madinah script also uses the same shape for some letters regardless of their position in a word (initial, medial, final, isolated), while Uthmani uses different shapes for different positions.
 
Madinah script is widely used and promoted in Saudi Arabia and other Arab countries that follow its religious and political leadership. It is also popular among Muslims who live in other regions but have affinity or admiration for Saudi Arabia and its version of Islam. Many Quran editions and publications are printed in Madinah script, along with Arabic text.
