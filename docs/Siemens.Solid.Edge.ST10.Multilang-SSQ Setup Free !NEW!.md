1. Download the SSQ release from a reliable source. The file name should be Siemens.Solid.Edge.ST10.Multilang-SSQ.iso or something similar. You will need a torrent client to download it.
2. Mount the ISO file using a virtual drive software such as Daemon Tools or PowerISO.
3. Run the setup.exe file from the mounted ISO file. You will see a welcome screen with the Siemens logo and the language options. Choose your preferred language and click Next.
4. Accept the license agreement and click Next.
5. Choose the installation type. You can either install Solid Edge with Standard Parts or without Standard Parts. Standard Parts are a library of common components that you can use in your designs. If you choose to install them, you will need more disk space and installation time.
6. Choose the installation folder. The default location is C:\Program Files\Siemens\Solid Edge ST10. You can change it if you want, but make sure you have enough disk space for the installation.
7. Choose the additional options. You can install Solid Edge Viewer, Solid Edge Help Collection, Solid Edge Web Publisher, and Solid Edge Simulation Express. These are optional components that enhance your experience with Solid Edge.
8. Click Install to start the installation process. It may take several minutes depending on your system configuration and the options you selected.
9. When the installation is complete, click Finish to exit the setup wizard.
10. Copy the contents of the folder SSQ from the mounted ISO file to the installation folder of Solid Edge. This will overwrite some files and apply the crack to activate Solid Edge.
11. Run Solid Edge from the Start menu or the desktop shortcut. You will see a splash screen with the SSQ logo and then the main interface of Solid Edge.
