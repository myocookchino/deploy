## How to Choose the Right Difficulty Level
 
Hitman Absolution offers five difficulty levels to suit different types of players. The difficulty level affects various aspects of the game, such as enemy intelligence, detection speed, number of checkpoints, availability of instinct mode, and user interface. Here is a brief overview of each difficulty level:

- Easy: This is the easiest mode for beginners and casual players. Enemies are less alert and aggressive, you have unlimited instinct mode, you can see enemies and targets through walls, you have frequent checkpoints, and you can use hints and guides.
- Normal: This is the standard mode for most players. Enemies are more aware and responsive, you have limited instinct mode, you can see enemies and targets through walls only when using instinct, you have fewer checkpoints, and you can use hints and guides.
- Hard: This is the challenging mode for experienced players. Enemies are smarter and tougher, you have very limited instinct mode, you can see enemies and targets through walls only when using instinct and standing still, you have rare checkpoints, and you can use hints but not guides.
- Expert: This is the hardcore mode for veteran players. Enemies are ruthless and lethal, you have no instinct mode, you can't see enemies and targets through walls at all, you have no checkpoints, and you can't use hints or guides.
- Purist: This is the ultimate mode for masochistic players. Enemies are unforgiving and relentless, you have no instinct mode, you can't see enemies and targets through walls at all, you have no checkpoints, and you have no user interface at all.

You can choose the difficulty level before starting a new game or a new mission. You can also change it during a mission by pausing the game and selecting Options. However, changing the difficulty level will reset your score for that mission.
 
## How to Complete Challenges
 
Hitman Absolution features a variety of challenges that test your skills as an assassin. Challenges are optional objectives that reward you with points and unlock new weapons, costumes, and abilities. Challenges can be related to stealth, combat, exploration, or creativity. Some examples of challenges are:

- Suit Only: Complete a mission without changing your suit.
- Infiltrator: Complete a mission without being spotted.
- Silent Assassin: Complete a mission without killing anyone except your targets.
- Evidence Collector: Find and collect all evidence in a mission.
- Chameleon: Use all disguises available in a mission.
- Signature Kill: Kill a target in a unique way.

You can view the challenges for each mission by pressing the Back button on Xbox 360 or the Select button on PS3. You can also see your progress towards completing them. You can replay any mission to complete more challenges or improve your score. Completing challenges will also increase your mastery level for each mission, which will unlock more starting locations and equipment options.
