Omnisphere 1.5.6 is a software synthesizer from Spectrasonics that combines a wide variety of hybrid real-time synthesis technologies, a grand library of psychoacoustic sounds, and many innovative features not seen before in software or hardware synthesizers. Omnisphere 1.5.6 is designed with a unique user interface, with increasing levels of functionality in order to reach the widest range of users - from musicians who just want to be inspired by sounds and customize them in a simple way, to professional players on the synthesizer and the most advanced sound developers[^1^].
 
Omnisphere 1.5.6 offers a host of hybrid synthesis and new control capabilities, including Variable Waveshaping DSP, Granular Synthesis, Timbre Shifting, FM, Polyphonic Ring Modulation, High Resolution Sample Playback, Harmonia, Dual Multimode Filter structure, Chaos Envelopes, improved Unison mode, and the innovative Flex-Mod modulation tracing system â to name just a few[^1^]. Omnisphere 1.5.6's huge internal library is filled with years of creative sampling experiments and thousands of patches created with inspiration. Spectrasonics pioneered some entirely new types of sampling for the instrumentâs internal library, including âPsychoacousticâ sounds and sound sources created with the Composite Morphing Technique (CMT), which transforms the harmony characteristics of one instrument into another[^1^]. As a bonus, part of the internal library is dedicated to presenting the best sample libraries from Spectrasonics[^1^]. When all these resources are combined with the STEAM engine, the sounds come to life.

Among the many unique properties that this new multi-timbral synthesizer offers, its flexible Arpeggiator with the worldâs first-ever combined Groove Lock and Stylus RMX, allowing the Arpeggiator model to constantly âswingâ with a hint of a repetitive RMX drum sample; Live Mode interface allows for seamless, interactive creative patch switching and layering; and built-in modulated FX Racks[^1^]. Omnisphere 1.5.6 is also the successor to the popular Spectrasonics Atmosphere instrument, and includes improved versions of all classic Atmosphere sounds. Whatever it was, the brand new internal Omnisphere library is 10 times larger than Atmosphere and includes thousands of completely new and diverse sounds[^1^].
