## How to Use STRINGS VSTi VST3 AAX v1.0.1-R2R
 
To use STRINGS VSTi VST3 AAX v1.0.1-R2R, you need to install it on your computer and load it as a plugin in your DAW of choice. You can then select from the 800+ presets that come with the plugin, or create your own sounds by tweaking the parameters of the string oscillators, filters, effects, and modulators.
 
The plugin has a simple and intuitive interface that lets you access all the features and controls easily. You can switch between two independent layers of sound, each with its own string oscillator, filter, envelope, LFO, and effects. You can also adjust the volume, pan, tuning, and transpose of each layer, and choose to stack or split them across the keyboard.
 
The string oscillator is the heart of the plugin, where you can choose from different types of picks, bows, and hammers to excite a modelled string. You can also adjust the material, damping, decay, stiffness, and coupling of the string to change its timbre and behavior. The string oscillator can produce a wide range of sounds, from realistic acoustic strings to synthetic plucks and pads.
 
The filter section allows you to shape the frequency spectrum of the sound with a low-pass, high-pass, band-pass, or notch filter. You can also modulate the filter cutoff and resonance with an envelope or an LFO for more dynamic sounds. The filter can handle extreme modulation while remaining musical and smooth.
 
The effects section offers four types of effects: reverb, equalizer, compressor, and guitar amplifier. You can use them to add space, warmth, punch, and distortion to your sounds. You can also adjust the dry/wet mix and bypass each effect individually.
 
The modulators section gives you two performance modulators per layer that respond to user-defined MIDI controls. You can assign them to any parameter of the plugin and create expressive and morphing sounds. Each preset comes with pre-assigned modulators that you can play in real time or automate in your DAW.
 
STRINGS VSTi VST3 AAX v1.0.1-R2R is a versatile and powerful string synthesizer plugin that can create realistic and expressive string sounds as well as synthetic and experimental ones. It is easy to use and fun to play with. Whether you need a solo violin, a lush string ensemble, or a plucky synth lead, STRINGS VSTi VST3 AAX v1.0.1-R2R can deliver it with style.
