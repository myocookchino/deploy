C How to Program 8th Edition is divided into 15 chapters and 5 appendices. The first chapter introduces the basics of C programming, such as variables, data types, operators, expressions, control statements, and functions. The second chapter covers the essentials of input/output operations, such as formatted and unformatted input/output, file processing, and command-line arguments. The third chapter explains how to use arrays and strings to store and manipulate data. The fourth chapter discusses pointers and pointer-based operations, such as dynamic memory allocation, pointer arithmetic, and function pointers.
 
The fifth chapter explores structured data types, such as structures, unions, bit fields, and enumerations. The sixth chapter covers the fundamentals of object-oriented programming in C, such as abstract data types, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. The seventh chapter introduces the concept of recursion and shows how to use it to solve various problems. The eighth chapter explains how to use the preprocessor to perform macro substitution, conditional compilation, and file inclusion. The ninth chapter covers advanced topics in C programming, such as variable-length argument lists, bitwise operators, type conversions, and error handling.
 
The tenth chapter presents some common C libraries and their functions, such as the standard library (stdlib.h), the math library (math.h), the string library (string.h), the time library (time.h), and the random number library (stdlib.h). The eleventh chapter discusses how to write secure C programs that avoid common vulnerabilities and exploits, such as buffer overflows, format string attacks, integer overflows, and memory leaks. The twelfth chapter introduces some features of C11 and C99 that are not covered in previous chapters, such as generic selection, static assertions, alignment specifiers, anonymous structures and unions, compound literals, designated initializers, variable-length arrays, flexible array members, restrict qualifiers, inline functions, and complex numbers.
