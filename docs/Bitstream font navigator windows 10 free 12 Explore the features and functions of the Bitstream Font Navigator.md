# How to Use Bitstream Font Navigator on Windows 10
 
Bitstream Font Navigator is a font manager that allows you to easily find, install, and uninstall fonts on your Windows 10 system. It is included in some versions of CorelDRAW Graphics Suite, but you can also download it separately from the Bitstream website[^1^]. Here are some steps to use Bitstream Font Navigator on Windows 10:
 
1. Launch Bitstream Font Navigator from the Start menu or the desktop shortcut.
2. In the left pane, browse to the folder where your fonts are stored. You can also use the Search box to find fonts by name, style, or format.
3. Select the fonts you want to add to your Font Catalog, which is a list of all the available fonts on your system. You can select multiple fonts by holding down the Ctrl key.
4. Right-click on the selected fonts and choose Add to Font Catalog. This will copy the fonts to a special folder and register them in the Windows registry.
5. In the right pane, you can see all the fonts in your Font Catalog. You can sort them by name, style, format, or size. You can also preview them by typing some text in the Sample box.
6. To install a font, right-click on it and choose Install. This will make the font available to all applications that use fonts.
7. To uninstall a font, right-click on it and choose Uninstall. This will remove the font from your system and delete it from the Font Catalog.

Bitstream Font Navigator is a handy tool for managing your fonts on Windows 10. It can help you organize your fonts, avoid duplicates, and save disk space. However, it is not compatible with some newer font formats, such as OpenType Variable Fonts[^2^]. If you encounter any problems with Bitstream Font Navigator, you can contact Bitstream support or visit their website for more information[^1^].

## What are OpenType Variable Fonts?
 
OpenType Variable Fonts are a new type of font that can offer more flexibility and efficiency than standard fonts. They are based on the OpenType font specification, which is a standard format for digital fonts that supports many languages and scripts, advanced typographic features, and rich graphic effects.
 
Unlike standard fonts, which have a fixed set of glyphs and properties for each weight, width, or style combination, variable fonts can have multiple variations of a typeface within a single font file. These variations are defined by one or more axes of variation, such as weight, width, slant, optical size, or any other design parameter that the font designer chooses. By adjusting the values along these axes, you can access any intermediate instance of the typeface, or even create custom instances that suit your needs.
 
For example, the following image shows a variable font with two axes of variation: weight and width. By changing the values along these axes, you can get different instances of the font, from thin and condensed to bold and extended:

Variable fonts can also have more than two axes of variation, allowing for more complex and expressive typography. For example, the following image shows a variable font with four axes of variation: weight, width, slant, and optical size. By changing the values along these axes, you can get different instances of the font that are suitable for different sizes and contexts:

Variable fonts have many benefits over standard fonts. They can:

- Reduce the number of font files and HTTP requests needed for a web page or an application.
- Save disk space and bandwidth by having a smaller file size than multiple standard fonts.
- Provide more control and fine-tuning over the appearance and layout of text.
- Enable dynamic and responsive typography that adapts to different devices, environments, and user preferences.
- Create new possibilities for creative expression and experimentation with typography.

To use variable fonts on your web pages or applications, you need to make sure that your operating system and browser support them. You also need to use CSS properties that allow you to specify and manipulate the variation settings of a variable font. These properties include:

- `@font-face`: To declare a variable font resource and its available axes of variation.
- `font-variation-settings`: To set the values for each axis of variation.
- `font-optical-sizing`: To enable or disable automatic adjustment of optical size based on font size.

In addition, some existing CSS properties can also affect the appearance of variable fonts, such as `font-weight`, `font-stretch`, `font-style`, `font-size-adjust`, and `font-feature-settings`. You need to be aware of how these properties interact with variable fonts and use them accordingly.
