## Self-Care and Nonprescription Therapy
 
Self-care is the process of managing one's own health and wellness without professional guidance. Nonprescription therapy is the use of over-the-counter medications, herbal remedies, and dietary supplements to treat minor ailments or enhance health. Both self-care and nonprescription therapy require a careful assessment of the patient's condition, medical history, drug allergies, and current medications. They also require an evaluation of the benefits and risks of the chosen therapy, as well as a monitoring plan for effectiveness and safety.
