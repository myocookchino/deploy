## Step 2: Prepare a USB Drive
 
You need a USB drive that has at least 8 GB of storage space and is formatted as Mac OS Extended (Journaled) with a GUID Partition Table. To format your USB drive, open Disk Utility on your Mac and select your USB drive from the sidebar. Click on the Erase tab and choose Mac OS Extended (Journaled) as the format and GUID Partition Table as the scheme. Click on Erase and wait for the process to finish.
 
## Step 3: Run UniBeast 1.5.3
 
After formatting your USB drive, double-click on the UniBeast 1.5.3 file that you downloaded in step 1 to launch the installer. Click on Continue and agree to the license agreement. On the Destination Select screen, choose your USB drive as the destination and click on Continue. On the Installation Type screen, choose Mountain Lion as the operating system and click on Continue. You can also customize some options such as Legacy USB Support, Laptop Support, or Graphics Mode if you need them for your specific hardware configuration. Click on Continue and enter your password when prompted. The installation will take some time depending on the speed of your USB drive.
 
## Step 4: Copy Mountain Lion Installer to USB Drive
 
Before you can use your UniBeast USB drive to install Mountain Lion on your PC or laptop, you need to copy the Mountain Lion installer app to your USB drive. You can download the Mountain Lion installer app from the Mac App Store if you have purchased it before or from other sources if you have access to them. Once you have the Mountain Lion installer app, right-click on it and choose Show Package Contents. Open the Contents folder and then the SharedSupport folder. Find the InstallESD.dmg file and copy it to your USB drive.
 
## Step 5: Boot from UniBeast USB Drive
 
Now you are ready to use your UniBeast USB drive to install Mountain Lion on your PC or laptop that supports Hackintosh. To do so, you need to change the boot order in your BIOS settings to make your USB drive the first boot device. Then restart your computer and press any key when you see the tonymacx86 logo on the screen. You will see a list of bootable devices, choose your USB drive and press Enter. You will then see the Chimera bootloader screen, where you can enter some boot flags if needed or just press Enter to start the installation process.
