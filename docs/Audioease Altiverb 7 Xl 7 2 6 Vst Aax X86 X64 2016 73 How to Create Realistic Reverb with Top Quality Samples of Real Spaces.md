## What is convolution reverb?
  
Convolution reverb is a type of reverb that uses samples of real spaces to create reverb effects. Unlike algorithmic reverb, which uses mathematical formulas to generate reverb, convolution reverb uses recordings of actual rooms, halls, stadiums, caves, or any other acoustic environment. These recordings are called impulse responses (IRs), and they capture the sound characteristics of the space, such as its size, shape, reflections, and decay.
  
By applying these IRs to any audio signal, convolution reverb can create realistic and natural-sounding reverb effects that match the original space. For example, you can make your vocals sound like they were recorded in a cathedral, or your guitar sound like it was played in a rock studio. Convolution reverb can also recreate vintage reverb gear, such as plates, springs, or digital units.
  
## What makes Audioease Altiverb 7 XL special?
  
Audioease Altiverb 7 XL is the most advanced and comprehensive convolution reverb plug-in on the market. It has several features and advantages that make it unique and superior to other convolution reverbs. Here are some of them:
  
- It has a huge and diverse library of IRs from all over the world. Audioease has been traveling the world for more than 20 years to record the acoustics of the best sounding spaces. The Altiverb 7 XL library contains hundreds of IRs from famous concert halls, opera houses, churches, studios, stadiums, caves, and more. You can also find IRs of vintage reverb gear and purpose-built echo chambers. Every month, new IRs are added for free to all registered Altiverb 7 XL users.
- It has a visual and intuitive browser that makes it easy to find and select IRs. You can browse IRs by clicking photos of rooms, or by using keywords, categories, or filters. You can also download and install new IRs with a single click. The browser shows you useful information about each IR, such as its size, duration, format, and source.
- It has a powerful and flexible engine that allows you to tweak and customize the reverb sound. You can adjust parameters such as pre-delay, decay time, damping, modulation, EQ, and more. You can also use automation and modulation envelopes to create dynamic and creative reverb effects. You can even reverse or warp IRs to create unusual sounds.
- It supports up to 5.1 surround input and output for immersive audio applications. You can use Altiverb 7 XL to create realistic spatial effects for film, TV, VR, or gaming projects. You can also use it to mix surround music or enhance stereo tracks with surround reverb.
- It is efficient on the CPU and compatible with most DAWs and formats. Altiverb 7 XL uses a smart algorithm that optimizes the CPU load based on the IR size and sampling rate. It also supports 64-bit processing and up to 384 kHz sampling rates. It is available as a VST, AAX (Native and TDM), AU (Audio Unit), MAS (MOTU Audio System), or RTAS (Real-Time Audio Suite) plug-in for Windows and Mac OS X.
