## What are the advantages of using 3D Systems 3D Lightyear 1.5.2?
 
Using 3D Systems 3D Lightyear 1.5.2 can bring you many benefits, such as:
 
- **Faster build preparation and slicing time**: According to 3D Systems, you can cut your build preparation and slice times by as much as half with 3D Lightyear compared to Unix-based Maestro software[^1^]. This means you can save time and money by reducing your machine idle time and increasing your throughput.
- **Better file management and transfer**: 3D Systems 3D Lightyear 1.5.2 can produce build files that are up to 70% smaller than Maestro files[^2^], which makes them easier to store and transfer to your SLA machines. You can also use network drives or removable media to transfer your files without any hassle.
- **Improved STL file repair**: If your STL files have any errors or gaps, you can use 3D Lightyear's powerful repair tools to fix them up to 150 times faster than Maestro[^2^]. You can also use the preview mode to check your repaired files before slicing them.
- **More control over part orientation and support generation**: With 3D Lightyear, you can easily rotate and scale your parts to fit your build platform and optimize your part quality and accuracy. You can also use the automatic or manual support generation tools to add supports to your parts with minimal material waste and post-processing time.
- **Year 2000 compliant**: Unlike Maestro software, which may have some issues with the year 2000 date format[^2^], 3D Lightyear is fully compliant with the Y2K standards and will ensure your productivity into the millennium.

## How to get started with 3D Systems 3D Lightyear 1.5.2?
 
If you are interested in using 3D Systems 3D Lightyear 1.5.2 for your SLA printing projects, you can get it for free with new machine purchases or if you are on a software maintenance contract with 3D Systems[^2^]. You can also contact 3D Systems for more details on how to upgrade from Maestro or other software versions.
